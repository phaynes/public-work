### Criteria: locate one recent (published in the last ten years) research study (needs to be a journal article) 
This journal article is published in 2023 and discusses Alexithymia in middle school students.

### Criteria: Original empirical research
The article contains original empirical research

### Criteria: one type of disability in relation to either primary/elementary; or secondary school students
The article studies 899 middle school students (ages 11 to 14)

## Analysis of article.
1. Alexithymia is negatively correlated with meaning in life and reciprocal filial piety, and positively correlated with Internet addiction.
2. Meaning in life is positively correlated with reciprocal filial piety and negatively correlated with Internet addiction.
3. Reciprocal filial piety is positively correlated with authoritarian filial piety and negatively correlated with Internet addiction.
4. Alexithymia can predict Internet addiction directly and indirectly through meaning in life.
5. Reciprocal filial piety moderates the relationship between meaning in life and Internet addiction; authoritarian filial piety does not have this moderating effect.
6. For middle school students with low reciprocal filial piety, meaning in life negatively predicts Internet addiction.
7.  For those with high reciprocal filial piety, there is no significant relationship between meaning in life and Internet addiction

Middle school in the United States typically serves students from around ages 11 to 14, covering grades 6 through 8. However, the exact age range can vary slightly depending on the local education system's organization. Some districts might have a different configuration, such as K-8 for elementary and middle combined or a junior high that includes grades 7 through 9. Generally, middle school is the transition period between elementary school and high school, focusing on preparing students for the more rigorous academic and social demands of high school.

In this context, "piety" refers to a quality of showing respect and devotion, typically within the framework of family relationships. Specifically:

Reciprocal filial piety implies a mutual respect and care between children and their parents, characterized by children's appreciation and support for their parents as well as parents' nurturing and guidance towards their children. This concept emphasizes a two-way relationship where both parties contribute to the welfare and support of each other.
Authoritarian filial piety, on the other hand, might refer to a more traditional and hierarchical approach to family relationships, where respect and care are expected primarily from the children towards their parents, often without the explicit expectation of reciprocity. This form of piety is based on authority, obedience, and respect for elders and family hierarchy.
In the study's findings, these forms of piety are linked to individuals' psychological states and behaviors, such as their sense of meaning in life and tendencies towards Internet addiction, suggesting that the nature of family relationships can significantly impact personal well-being and habits.
