what is middle school in uS education by age group.

Middle school in the United States typically serves students from around ages 11 to 14, covering grades 6 through 8. However, the exact age range can vary slightly depending on the local education system's organization. Some districts might have a different configuration, such as K-8 for elementary and middle combined or a junior high that includes grades 7 through 9. Generally, middle school is the transition period between elementary school and high school, focusing on preparing students for the more rigorous academic and social demands of high school.
